# Key points
# Smoothing is a very powerful technique used all across data analysis. 
# It is designed to detect trends in the presence of noisy data in cases in which the 
# shape of the trend is unknown. 
# The concepts behind smoothing techniques are extremely useful in machine learning because 
# conditional expectations/probabilities can be thought of as trends of unknown shapes that 
# we need to estimate in the presence of uncertainty.
