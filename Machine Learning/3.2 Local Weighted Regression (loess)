# Key points
# A limitation of the bin smoothing approach is that we need small windows for 
# the approximately constant assumptions to hold which may lead to imprecise estimates of 
# f(x) . Local weighted regression (loess) permits us to consider larger window sizes.
# One important difference between loess and bin smoother is that we assume the smooth function
# is locally linear in a window instead of constant.
# The result of loess is a smoother fit than bin smoothing because we use larger sample sizes 
# to estimate our local parameters.
# Code
# The full code can be found in the .R file Handout at the beginning of the section.
