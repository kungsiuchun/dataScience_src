# Key points
# The general idea of smoothing is to group data points into strata in which the value of  
# f(x)  can be assumed to be constant. We can make this assumption because we think  f(x)  
# changes slowly and, as a result,  f(x)  is almost constant in small windows of time. 
# This assumption implies that a good estimate for  f(x)  is the average of the  Yi  values 
# in the window. The estimate is:
#   f^(x0)=1N0???i???A0Yi 
# In smoothing, we call the size of the interval  |x???x0|  satisfying the particular condition 
# the window size, bandwidth or span.
