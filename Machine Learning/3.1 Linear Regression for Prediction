# Key points
# Linear regression can be considered a machine learning algorithm. 
# Although it can be too rigid to be useful, it works rather well for some challenges. 
# It also serves as a baseline approach: if you can¡¦t beat it with a more complex approach, 
# you probably want to stick to linear regression.
